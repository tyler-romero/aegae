# Aegae

Just me learning CUDA and Triton.

> Suddenly down from the mountain's rocky crags
Poseidon stormed with giant, lightning strides
and the looming peaks and tall timber quaked
beneath his immortal feet as the sea lord surged on.
Three great strides he took, on the fourth he reached his goal,
**Aegae** port where his famous halls are built in the green depths,
the shimmering golden halls of the god that stand forever.
